
Task: Create a Java program that calculates the area of a rectangle.

Requirements:
1. The program should prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle.
2. It should then calculate the area using the formula: area = length * width.
3. Finally, it should display the calculated area to the user.

Here's a basic structure for your Java program:

java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class RectangleAreaCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object to read input from the user
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt the user to enter the length of the rectangle
        System.out.print("Enter the length of the rectangle: ");
        double length = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Prompt the user to enter the width of the rectangle
        System.out.print("Enter the width of the rectangle: ");
        double width = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Calculate the area of the rectangle
        double area = length * width;

        // Display the calculated area to the user
        System.out.println("The area of the rectangle is: " + area);

        // Close the Scanner object
        scanner.close();
    }
}


To run this program:
1. Open a text editor and copy the code into a new file.
2. Save the file with a .java extension (e.g., RectangleAreaCalculator.java).
3. Open a command prompt or terminal.
4. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
5. Compile the Java file by running: javac RectangleAreaCalculator.java
6. Run the compiled program by running: java RectangleAreaCalculator
